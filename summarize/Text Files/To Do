Modules/Code Left to Write
--------------------------

1 - Module that combines everything (at the end)

2 - Module for the frontend (at the end?) (using turtle? tkinter? something else?)

3 - Separate modules for mac and windows installer

4 - Script for program?

5 - Module for citations or works cited -- I can add that to the examples module (similar code) __ DONE

6 - Module to check if the summary covers all the major topics of the document?

7 - Module that checks for sentence similarity?? Sentence similar to more sentences is more important?? Also factor in
the importance of sentences that the core sentence is similar to

8 -- Module that ranks it based on the sentiment of sentences (positive or negative)?? (positives - negatives)??

9 -- Add to length module to penalize the sentences more they are away form the begining because they get less
important as they move away __ DONE

10 -- Module for centroid words. Sentence with more centroid words and more central to the topic. (Find out if this is
the same thing as high frequency words)




Expansion --

1 - To make the summary an actual coherent summary instead of just a collection of sentences (Options down below)

    a - Module(s) for keyphrase extraction on our summary output and use this exraction to reconstruct a coherent summary??

    b - Module(s) for turning a string of sentences into a summary??

2 - Compatible with more document types such as PDFs

3 -- Convert into an actual app?? Maybe, not sure?? It would require us build a more comprehensive frontend and a
caching mechanism in the backend (and would require an internet server??)
